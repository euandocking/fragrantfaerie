        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <p>I started working with essential oils over 25 years ago after doing a course on Aromatherapy. I love the healing properties of the oils and the fact that they have been used for thousands of years. After raising my 3 children I decided to then start my own business blending creams and oils for people who came to me with different life condition. I soon discovered how much I love working with these amazing oils and creating beautiful synergistic blends.</p>

        <p>I do absolutely love what I do, I am passionate about making good quality products, I hand make all Fragrant Faerie Mood sprays, hand and foot creams, body butters, and hand gels. The creams are made with natural ingredients and blended with essential oils. I have always had a love of these oils, they have been used for thousands of years, long before allopathic medicine was discovered. I don't use chemicals in my products. My handmade wax melts are made with Soy wax and non toxic fragrance oils and have 25% fragrance which gives a fantastic scent throw hot and cold.</p>

        <p>I infuse Reiki energy into all of my products, everything is made with Love and Light in the hope that this energy reaches all who buy from Fragrant Faerie 💗🙏</p>
